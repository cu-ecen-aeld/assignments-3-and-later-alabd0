oop massage it display the error/fault that happens, the cause of it, state of the processor at the time that happened, including the contents
of the CPU registers  and the content of the stack.
As we can see the first massages says
> Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000.

This means this fault comming from NULL pointer dereference at.
Virtual address is NULL so it can't be dereferenced and this problem
The most relevant information here is the instruction pointer (PC), the address of the faulty instruction is faulty_write+0x14/0x20 
> This message was generated by writing to a device owned by the faulty module


# assembly content associatedwith an object file 

> pc : faulty_write+0x14/0x20 [faulty]

Here we see that we were in the function faulty_write, which is located in the faulty
module (which is listed in square brackets). The hex numbers indicate that the
instruction pointer was 14 bytes into the function, which appears to be 20 (hex) bytes
long.
so if objdump faulty.ko 

```
arch64-buildroot-linux-uclibc/bin/objdump -S faulty.ko 

faulty.ko:     file format elf64-littleaarch64


Disassembly of section .text:

0000000000000000 <faulty_write>:
   0:	d503245f 	bti	c
   4:	d2800001 	mov	x1, #0x0                   	// #0
   8:	d2800000 	mov	x0, #0x0                   	// #0
   c:	d503233f 	paciasp

  18:	d65f03c0 	ret
  1c:	d503201f 	nop
```

you will find this instruction is cause of the problem:
